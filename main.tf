"Smooth Jazz is a subgenre of contemporary jazz that emerged in the late 20th century and is characterized by its focus on creating a mellow, relaxing, and often commercially accessible sound. Smooth jazz often features a prominent use of saxophones, keyboards, and synthesizers, with a strong emphasis on melody and a generally laid-back groove. Smooth Jazz is known for its smooth and polished production values, making it more accessible to a wider audience compared to some other jazz subgenres. Smooth Jazz is often played on radio stations that specialize in easy listening or instrumental music." - ChatGPT
