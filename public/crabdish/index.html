        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 uncooked dungeness crab (of 1-2 pounds or uncooked crab legs of the same weight)</li>
            <li>6 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>4 shallots</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>1 tomato (canned also works)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons curry powder</li>
            <li>1/3 - 1 teaspoon cayenne powder (depending on your spicy heat tolerance)</li>
            <li>1 cup of chicken stock</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons coconut milk (can be skipped if preferred)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop up and dice the garlic cloves, shallots, onion, and tomato. Have your crab cleaned and separated into pieces (crab legs, crab joints, claws, top shell).</li>
            <li>Add 4 tablespoons of cooking oil to your pan, wok, or dutch oven. Sear both sides of your crab pieces until the crab changes color on medium high. Then, remove crab.</li>
            <li>Add 4 more tablespoons of oil into the wok to the existing oil that remains. The crab flavor is preserved using the same wok and existing oil. When the oil is hot, add the diced shallots, onion, and tomato on medium high heat. Cook until you can smell the aroma (before it becomes golden brown).</li>
            <li>Lower heat to a low heat and add curry and cayenne powder. The idea is to cook these powders and allow the flavors to release, but be careful! Powder substances can toast or burn easily. Cook until flavors are released, usually for a minute or so, but if the wok dries or powder is starting to turn dark, immediately jump to step 5.</li>
            <li>Add in your chicken stock to your wok. After this step, you have created a tasty sauce base for your crab.</li>
            <li>Add your crab. Cook for 10 minutes with lid closed. The liquid will begin to thicken. Occasionally move the crab pieces around so all pieces can cook and absorb flavor. Add the coconut milk to create an even richer sauce. Taste and depending on your preference, you may add more water, coconut milk, salt, or sugar. For salt and sugar, the recommended amount is 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon sugar.</li>
            <li>Plate your crab.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your dish!</li>
        </ol>
