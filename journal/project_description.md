## Project Description - TerraTowns


TerraTowns is a community website that acts as a hub to discover and connect terraformers to each other's self-hosted personal websites in the style of Geocities of 2023.

Terraformers will write the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to launch their Terra House. A Terra House is a simple Content Management System (CMS) that will allow you to author your own personal website and connect it to the TerraTowns network.

Terraformers need to choose a **theme or topic of interest** and build their page around existing community hubs.
